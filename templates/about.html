        <p><strong>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</strong> is a developmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts, and experiences the world. It is called a <b>spectrum</b> because it includes a wide range of strengths, challenges, and needs. Autism is not an illness, but a different way of experiencing the world. Many people with autism have unique talents and perspectives that enrich our communities. Acceptance and support make a big difference.</p>
        <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Autism can affect social interaction, communication, and behavior.</li>
            <li>It is called a spectrum because every person with autism is different and may have a unique combination of strengths and challenges.</li>
            <li>There is no single known cause of autism; it is believed to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors.</li>
            <li>Many people with autism have strong attention to detail, exceptional memory, or special skills in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Early intervention, understanding, and acceptance can help people with autism thrive.</li>
            <li>Supportive therapies, education, and inclusive environments can greatly improve quality of life for individuals with autism.</li>
            <li>Autism is a lifelong condition, but many individuals can live independently with the right support and accommodations.</li>
            <li>Autism affects about 1 in 100 children worldwide, but awareness and support are growing every year.</li>
            <li>Increased public awareness and scientific research are leading to better diagnostic tools and personalized interventions.</li>
