<h2>What is Autism?</h2>
<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects how a person communicates, interacts, and experiences the world. It is called a "spectrum" because it includes a wide range of strengths, challenges, and needs.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Common signs:</strong> Difficulty with social interaction, repetitive behaviors, unique strengths and differences.</li>
    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> May include challenges in communication, sensitivity to sensory input, and preference for routines.</li>
    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Early intervention, understanding, and acceptance can help people with autism thrive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember: Autism is not an illness. Many people with autism have unique talents and perspectives that enrich our communities. Acceptance and support make a big difference!</p>
