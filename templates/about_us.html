<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><strong>Autism Predictor</strong> is a project dedicated to raising awareness and supporting early detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using modern technology.</p>
<p>Our mission is to make autism screening more accessible and to empower families, educators, and healthcare professionals with easy-to-use tools. We believe that early awareness and understanding can make a positive impact in the lives of people with autism and their loved ones.</p>
<p>This website uses machine learning to provide a quick, informative prediction based on user input. We encourage everyone to use this tool as a first step and to seek professional advice for any concerns.</p>
<p><em>Together, we can build a more inclusive and supportive world for all.</em></p>
